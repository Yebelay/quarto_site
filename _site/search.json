    "title": "How far does that ferris wheel roll?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What I love about data visualization is how it combines creative thinking (what do I want to show?) with technical programming skills (how do I show this?). Nowhere do you combine these two things as elegantly as in the weekly tidy tuesday challenges. Here, data wizards around the word play and practice with fascinating datasets from chocolate bar ratings to the mobility of ERASMUS students to – this week – data on ferris wheels around the world.1 As someone who goes pale in any kind of rollercoaster, ferris wheels feel just about advantageous enough to start my own tidy tuesday journey.\n\n\n\nBefore opening R, I think about what I find fascinating about the topic and what I want to convey with my visualization. Here I am sticking to some descriptive analysis and won’t overthink it, so let’s just go with one of the first thing that came to my mind… ferris wheels are really big!\n\nIf a ferris wheel would be an actual wheel, how far would it travel during one rotation?2\n\nThe message gives me part of the structure for the visualization. Here, I want to select a few examples from different countries and show the diameter on the x-axis. I’ve created a lot of horizontal bar charts for a consultancy this summer, so naturally this is my starting point.\nA great thing about these just-for-fun challenges is that you can use them to add 1-2 new skills to your visualization toolbox. For this challenge I want to learn two things:\n\nHow do I add icons (ferris wheels 🎡, obviously) instead of dots in the chart?\nHow do I add country flags on the y-axis.\n\nI don’t want to spend the entire evening on this, so I think it is important to limit myself to only these two new features. I will also concentrate on them and not care too much (yet) about other things, like titles, background, themes, etc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBecause this isn’t a mystery novel, I am giving away how the visualization will look like in the end. Don’t click if you want to keep the suspense…\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these initial thoughts out of the way, I can roughly sketch the visualization process and outline of this post.\n\nA first look at the data. Choose which points to show.\nCreate the simplest graph that shows the intended message.\nAdd the ferris wheel icons.\nAdd the country flags.\nClean up the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s first install the necessary packages and load and save the data.\n#install.packages(c(\"tidytuesdayR\", \"tidyverse\", \"here\", \"ggimage\", \"countrycode\", \"ggtext\"))\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n#data &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2022-08-09\")$wheels\n#write_rds(data, here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"data\", \"wheels\"))\ndata &lt;- read_rds(here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"data\", \"wheels\"))\n\n\n\nThe entire dataset collects 22 variables on 73 ferris wheels in 26 different countries. This is way to much information to display, so let’s keep only a handful of ferris wheels and only information on their name, country, height and diameter.\n\ndata &lt;- data |&gt; \n  select(country, name, height, diameter) |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt; \n  filter(height == max(height, na.rm = T),\n         country %in% c(\"Austria\", \"Canada\", \"China\", \"Mexico\", \"UK\", \"USA\")) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(across(c(height, diameter), round, 0),\n         country = factor(country))\n\nThis is the data that we will use. As a comparison, I will add data from a more typical wheel: my dutch bicycle wheel.\n\ndata &lt;- bind_rows(data, tibble(country = \"Netherlands\", name = \"Philipp's bike wheel\", height = 0.67, diameter = 0.67))\nknitr::kable(data)\n\n\n\n\ncountry\nname\nheight\ndiameter\n\n\n\n\nChina\nBeijing Great Wheel\n693.00\n643.00\n\n\nUSA\nGolden Gate Flyer\n728.00\n700.00\n\n\nUK\nLondon Eye\n443.00\n394.00\n\n\nCanada\nNiagara SkyWheel\n175.00\n167.00\n\n\nMexico\nStar of Puebla\n262.00\n229.00\n\n\nAustria\nWiener Riesenrad\n212.00\n200.00\n\n\nNetherlands\nPhilipp’s bike wheel\n0.67\n0.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(country), x = diameter)) + \n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       # x = \"Diameter of the highest ferris wheel in the country (in meter)\"\n       title = \"How far do you travel during one rotation in the largest ferris wheels?\",\n       caption = \"Data from ferriswheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 800)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\np +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = country, yend = country, x = 0, xend = diameter), linetype = \"dashed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t pretty, but that’s not the point. Having a bare-minimum working example helps to think about whether the graph type fits and what can be done to emphasise the key message. It also helps to create a to-do list of things to improve: like a different order of ferris wheels, maybe adding an empty row to separate the bike data from the ferris wheel data, a label or subtitle that puts the ferris wheel in relation to the bike wheel, another background color, adding ‘meter’ to the x-axis and more). But let us first tackle the two big learnings that I wanted to get out of the challenge: replacing the dots with icons (now I also need a bike, 🚲) and adding the country flags.\n\n\n\nAs always, there are many ways to Rome. Here I am going with the ggimage package maintained by Guangchuang YU. I have not used this before, but a look at the online vignette makes me hopeful that I can use this for the ferris wheel icons and the country flags 😃\nThere are two ways we can go. The first is to use the ggimage::geom_emoji and to insert the ferris wheel and bicycle emojis that I have used throughout the post. That seems simple, we just need the unicode to pass it to the function. That’s easy to look up at, e.g. https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html.\n\ndata$size = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 0.075, data$diameter / max(data$diameter) * 0.25)\np +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(country), yend = fct_rev(country), x = 0, xend = diameter), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_emoji(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", \"1f6b2\", \"1f3a1\")), position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.3) - 0.25), size = data$size)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks OK. The most complicated part was actually that I wanted to scale the size of the image by the size of the ferris wheel, which required making an extra size column and experimenting a lot with position_nudge to let the dashed line go to the bottom of the icon, not to the middle. But I am not super happy with the emoji’s, so let’s try to download some images of ferris wheels and use those with ggimage::geom_image() instead.\nI’ll first download a simple transparent ferris wheel png file (from here) and use a bike icon (from here).\n\nferris_path &lt;- here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"images\", \"ferriswheel.png\")\nbike_path &lt;- here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"images\", \"bike.png\")\n\np1 &lt;- p +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(country), yend = fct_rev(country), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", \n               position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(\n    aes(image = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)), \n    position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25, \n                              x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)), \n    size = data$size * 1.5)\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m happy with this. Onwards to do the country flags!\n\n\n\nIn the plots so far, I kept the country names on the y-axis. However, I would prefer to use the actual names of the ferris wheel and replace the country names with flags. We’ll continue with the ggimage package, which contains a geom_flag() function. The package expects country codes (e.g. NL, US), so we need to transform the names by hand using the countrycodes package.\n\n# Create the country labels from the country names\ndata$code &lt;- countrycode::countrycode(data$country, origin = \"country.name\", destination = \"iso2c\") \n\n# Sort the factor levels of the 'name' variable alphabetically *by country* (the combination of arrange and fct_inorder does that, there are surely smarter ways)\ndata &lt;- data |&gt; arrange(country)\ndata$name &lt;- fct_inorder(factor(data$name))\n\n# Create the graph again from scratch because instead of mapping the country to the y axis, I now\n# map the name to the y axis. Again, surely there are smarter ways to do that...\n# I also move the flags a bit to the left of the x axis and expand the limits of the plot accordingly.\np2 &lt;- \n  ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(name), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(name), yend = fct_rev(name), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", \n               position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)),\n                      position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25,\n                                                x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)),\n                      size = data$size * 1.5) +\n  ggimage::geom_flag(x = -70, aes(image = code)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       title = \"How far do you travel during one rotation in the largest ferris wheels?\",\n       caption = \"Data from ferriswheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-50, 800)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks fine. The main headache in the code chunk above was replacing the mapping of the y axis to show the name (and not the country) and correcting the ordering of the observations.\n\n\n\nI am happy with how the flags and ferris wheels turned out and am now ready to go back to the to-do list from the beginning with some minor things to clean up the graph. This is a playful challenge and ferris wheels are fun, so let’s go for a very light pinkish background colour. I am also adding a text box (using the ggtext package) to use my bicycle wheel as an example to show just how big these ferris wheels are.\n\n\nCode\nturns &lt;- pull(round(data[which(data$diameter == max(data$diameter)), \"diameter\"] / data[data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", \"diameter\"]))\ndata$name &lt;- fct_relevel(data$name, \"Philipp's bike wheel\")\n\np3 &lt;- \n  ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(name), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(name), yend = fct_rev(name), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", alpha = 0.5,\n               position = position_nudge(y = -0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)),\n                      position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25,\n                                                x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)),\n                      size = data$size * 1.5) +\n  ggimage::geom_flag(x = -70, aes(image = code)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       title = \"How far do you travel with one rotation of the largest wheels in the world?\",\n       caption = \"Visualization by Philipp Kollenda / @pkollenda . Accompanying blog post on my website. \\n Data from ferriswheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  ggtext::geom_textbox(aes(x = 300, y = 6.75, hjust = 0,\n                           label = glue::glue(\"My bike wheel has to &lt;span style='color: red;'&gt;turn {turns} times&lt;/span&gt; to travel the same distance as one rotation with the largest ferris wheel.\")),\n                       fill = \"papayawhip\", width = unit(6, \"cm\"), size = 3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-50, 800), labels = scales::label_number(suffix = \" meter\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\", plot.title = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(size = 20, padding = margin(c(10, 10, 20, 10))),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12)) +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FFFAFA\"))\np3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am happy with how this visualization turned out and glad I learned something about how to insert flags, icons and other images with the ggimage package. I will now hop on my bicycle and think of the Golden Gate Flyer… approximately every 1045 (bike) wheel turn."

    "title": "Build a simple website with R and Quarto in under 30 10 minutes.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I am especially excited about the possibility to quickly build websites (for blogs, teaching, sharing notes, publishing research etc.) with Quarto, without having to leave my R environment where I do all my coding anyways. Let’s get started!\n\nLet’s start by building a very simple website. I have three things on my wishlist:\n\nthe website should have multiple pages,\nan intuitive way to navigate between them and\nshow some images, code and output.\n\nWe won’t worry about hosting yet (that’s for another post) and simply use quarto.pub (more on that below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Here is how to get a website up and running in three steps\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, start a new project and choose Quarto website.\nChange content in the .qmd files and configuration in the .yml file.\nPublish to quarto pub via the terminal.\n\n\n\nHere is the final website https://philipp.quarto.pub/my-first-website But, let’s look at each of the steps in more detail.\n\nStep 1: Create the Quarto website project\nIn RStudio, we create a new project and choose Quarto website from the list of available templates. If that does not show up for you, chances are that you need to update RStudio to the latest version (i.e. RStudio 2022.07.1+554 “Spotted Wakerobin” works).\nA click on create project will create the scaffolding for our new website:\n\nTwo .qmd files that will become pages on our website.\nA .yml file that we use to keep track of the options.\nA styles.css file that we use to customize the appearance of the website1.\n\nIf we click on “Render” (or use Shift + Cmd + K) the document will (hopefully) render and show up in the Viewer pane of RStudio. That’s all and we could already publish this as a functioning website (🥳), but let’s add at least a minimal amount of our own content.\n\n\nStep 2: Changing the content (.qmd) and the structure (.yml) of our website.\nWhen we initialized the project, Quarto graciously already created two .qmd files which will be two pages on our website and a .yml file which records settings about the structure, general options, appearance and so on.\nWe are going to change the default content of the index.qmd file and the name and content of the about.qmd file. To do that, simply open the respective .qmd file and edit what you want to change. We won’t focus here on how to author Quarto documents, but the documentation on https://quarto.org/docs/authoring is amazing. For completeness, I put the code that I used in our website at the bottom of this post.\nNow, ideally we want to see the effects of our changes immediately. There are two options. We can switch on “Render on Save” and see the updated page in RStudios Viewer pane whenever we save. Or – way cooler IMHO – we can preview the entire website by typing quarto preview in the terminal field of RStudio (next to the console, where???).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview a website without publishing it by typing quarto preview in the terminal.\n\n\n\nWhere the .qmd files tell the browser what the website should display, the .yml file tells the browser how to structure the website. This is where you change the design, add pages, choose a logo and so much more. We’ll not go into detail on the site configuration yaml here and just focus on getting a simple website up-and-running, but luckily the Quarto team has you covered.\n\n\nStep 3: Publish your website.\nThis is it! It is time to let our creation leave the confines of the local computer and roam the world wide web. But we need a home address for our website and for the sake of using the simplest possible solution we will publish the website using quarto pub.\nIf you are already signed up and authenticated for Quarto Pub, great! Keep reading below.\n\n\nOtherwise click here to show the details.\n\nIf you still need to make an account, go to the quarto pub website (https://quartopub.com/), click Sign up, confirm your email and choose a username. The username will be in the URL of every website you create, so best to choose something highly professional 🤓.\n\nOnce you created your account (or if you already had one), open https://quartopub.com (this should show an empty profile page if you have not previously created a website) and just keep it open.\nNow comes the magic. Head back to RStudio and type quarto publish quarto-pub in the terminal (termi-WHAT?). If you are logged in to quarto pub in a browser, the terminal will show ? Publish with account:, your email address on the next line and in gray the words Use another account…. Don’t be fooled (like I was). This is not an error message and the console is not trying to tell you to use another account, it’s merely asking… So, confidently press Enter and it will ask about the site name. Press enter again and voilà, Quarto will upload your .qmd and .yml files to quarto pub and publish your website.\nYou (and everyone else!) can now see your website at YOUR-USERNAME.quarto.pub/YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME/. Here is the site that I just created in during this post https://philipp.quarto.pub/my-first-website/.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nStupid mistakes that tripped me up and that you don’t need to repeat.\n\nWhere is the terminal in RStudio?\nIf you do not use the terminal often it is easy to overlook it even though it is hidden in plain sight.  ##### Why does quarto pub ask me a different name / email address… When I first published this site, I diligently typed quarto publish quarto-pub in the terminal and was greeted by the message: “Use a different name…”.\n\n\nI fixed a typo but already published the site, what now?\nDon’t despair, unlike certain social media sites, quarto.pub does come with an edit button. Simply change what you want to change in the .qmd or .yml files and don’t forget to publish again via the termina. The console will ask you if you want to update the already published site… yes, please! That last step is easy to miss though, because RStudio’s Render on Save and Preview make it so easy to expect that everything just updates automatically.\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the index.qmd file.\nNote that I am not actually including the first line, only the part beginning with the yaml dashes (---).\n```{r}\n---\ntitle: \"Welcome to my first website\"\n---\n\nThis is a Quarto website that I created in just a few minutes. Read about it here and find amazing resources on <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.\n\n![](images/screenshot.png)\n```\n\n\nThe content of the about.qmd file.\n---\ntitle: \"Ferries Wheels\"\n---\n\n## Some fun with ferries wheels\n\n```{r}\n#| label: ferries-plot\n#| code-line-numbers: true\n#| code-fold: true\n#| message: false\n# install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\") install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n#data <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2022-08-09\")$wheels\ndata <- read_rds(\"data/wheels\")\nhighest <- data |> \n  group_by(country) |> \n  filter(height == max(height, na.rm = T),\n         country %in% c(\"Canada\", \"China\", \"Mexico\", \"Taiwan\", \"Japan\", \"Philippines\", \"UK\", \"USA\")) |> \n  select(country, height, diameter)\nggplot(highest, aes(y = fct_rev(factor(country)), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = country, yend = country, x = 0, xend = diameter), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       # x = \"Diameter of the highest ferries wheel in the country (in meter)\"\n       title = \"How far do you travel during one rotation in the highest ferries wheels?\",\n       caption = \"Data from ferriewheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 800)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWe won’t worry about customizing anything yet and the file is empty anyways.↩︎"

What Motivates Impact Investors’ Lending to Firms in Low-Income Countries (Journal of Banking & Finance, 2022 | open-access link)\n\nI analyze 70,000 transactions by retail impact investors on a peer-to-peer lending platform that intermediates loans to firms in low-income countries. Loans pay interest to investors and publicize indicators of expected social impact. Financial returns significantly influence investors’ decisions: a one percentage point increase in the interest rate increases funding speed seven-fold, investment probability two-fold and transaction size by 122 Euro. Expected social impact influences investors’ perception but has no influence (for female empowerment, employees and beneficiaries) or limited influence (for turnover) on investors’ funding decisions. When all available loans pay the same interest rates, female borrowers - but not firms with many employees or beneficiaries - are more likely to be chosen, suggesting that variation in financial returns can crowd out salient dimensions of social impact. The study implies that peer-to-peer lending platforms should function as gatekeepers of social impact and cannot outsource the evaluation of social impact to retail impact investors.\n\n\nI’m excited to share my first-ever publication 🥳At times doing a PhD feels like filling a pool with water one cup at a time and it's difficult to see progress.

Using panel data from 2015 and 2017 we show that the intervention was successful at delivering its immediate goals.

Contract farming significantly improved the sales prices of farmers, and knowledge of avocado-farming practices and led to increased investments into the Hass avocado variety which is in higher demand in export markets. We find suggestive, albeit not statistically significant, evidence that contract farming improved farmer income and shifted labour from family to hired labour. At the same time, contract farmers produced less of the local avocado variety, leading to a significant decrease in total quantity sold during the transition to the export-oriented Hass avocado variety. We contribute to the literature by quantifying the impact of a multi-layered contract farming intervention. Panel data allows us to estimate a doubly-robust difference-in-differences design, giving us more confidence to interpret our estimates as causal evidence of contract farming than traditional cross-sectional studies allow for."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What I love about data visualization is how it combines creative thinking (what do I want to show?) with technical programming skills (how do I show this?). Nowhere do you combine these two things as elegantly as in the weekly tidy tuesday challenges. Here, data wizards around the word play and practice with fascinating datasets from chocolate bar ratings to the mobility of ERASMUS students to – this week – data on ferris wheels around the world.1 As someone who goes pale in any kind of rollercoaster, ferris wheels feel just about advantageous enough to start my own tidy tuesday journey.\n\n\n\nBefore opening R, I think about what I find fascinating about the topic and what I want to convey with my visualization. Here I am sticking to some descriptive analysis and won’t overthink it, so let’s just go with one of the first thing that came to my mind… ferris wheels are really big!\n\nIf a ferris wheel would be an actual wheel, how far would it travel during one rotation?2\n\nThe message gives me part of the structure for the visualization. Here, I want to select a few examples from different countries and show the diameter on the x-axis. I’ve created a lot of horizontal bar charts for a consultancy this summer, so naturally this is my starting point.\nA great thing about these just-for-fun challenges is that you can use them to add 1-2 new skills to your visualization toolbox. For this challenge I want to learn two things:\n\nHow do I add icons (ferris wheels 🎡, obviously) instead of dots in the chart?\nHow do I add country flags on the y-axis.\n\nI don’t want to spend the entire evening on this, so I think it is important to limit myself to only these two new features. I will also concentrate on them and not care too much (yet) about other things, like titles, background, themes, etc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBecause this isn’t a mystery novel, I am giving away how the visualization will look like in the end. Don’t click if you want to keep the suspense…\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these initial thoughts out of the way, I can roughly sketch the visualization process and outline of this post.\n\nA first look at the data. Choose which points to show.\nCreate the simplest graph that shows the intended message.\nAdd the ferris wheel icons.\nAdd the country flags.\nClean up the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s first install the necessary packages and load and save the data.\n#install.packages(c(\"tidytuesdayR\", \"tidyverse\", \"here\", \"ggimage\", \"countrycode\", \"ggtext\"))\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n#data &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2022-08-09\")$wheels\n#write_rds(data, here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"data\", \"wheels\"))\ndata &lt;- read_rds(here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"data\", \"wheels\"))\n\n\n\nThe entire dataset collects 22 variables on 73 ferris wheels in 26 different countries. This is way to much information to display, so let’s keep only a handful of ferris wheels and only information on their name, country, height and diameter.\n\ndata &lt;- data |&gt; \n  select(country, name, height, diameter) |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt; \n  filter(height == max(height, na.rm = T),\n         country %in% c(\"Austria\", \"Canada\", \"China\", \"Mexico\", \"UK\", \"USA\")) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(across(c(height, diameter), round, 0),\n         country = factor(country))\n\nThis is the data that we will use.

Having a bare-minimum working example helps to think about whether the graph type fits and what can be done to emphasise the key message. It also helps to create a to-do list of things to improve: like a different order of ferris wheels, maybe adding an empty row to separate the bike data from the ferris wheel data, a label or subtitle that puts the ferris wheel in relation to the bike wheel, another background color, adding ‘meter’ to the x-axis and more). But let us first tackle the two big learnings that I wanted to get out of the challenge: replacing the dots with icons (now I also need a bike, 🚲) and adding the country flags.\n\n\n\nAs always, there are many ways to Rome. Here I am going with the ggimage package maintained by Guangchuang YU. I have not used this before, but a look at the online vignette makes me hopeful that I can use this for the ferris wheel icons and the country flags 😃\nThere are two ways we can go. The first is to use the ggimage::geom_emoji and to insert the ferris wheel and bicycle emojis that I have used throughout the post. That seems simple, we just need the unicode to pass it to the function. That’s easy to look up at, e.g. https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html.\n\ndata$size = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 0.075, data$diameter / max(data$diameter) * 0.25)\np +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(country), yend = fct_rev(country), x = 0, xend = diameter), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_emoji(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", \"1f6b2\", \"1f3a1\")), position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.3) - 0.25), size = data$size)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks OK. The most complicated part was actually that I wanted to scale the size of the image by the size of the ferris wheel, which required making an extra size column and experimenting a lot with position_nudge to let the dashed line go to the bottom of the icon, not to the middle. But I am not super happy with the emoji’s, so let’s try to download some images of ferris wheels and use those with ggimage::geom_image() instead.\nI’ll first download a simple transparent ferris wheel png file (from here) and use a bike icon (from here).\n\nferris_path &lt;- here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"images\", \"ferriswheel.png\")\nbike_path &lt;- here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"images\", \"bike.png\")\n\np1 &lt;- p +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(country), yend = fct_rev(country), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", \n               position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(\n    aes(image = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)), \n    position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25, \n                              x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)), \n    size = data$size * 1.5)\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m happy with this. Onwards to do the country flags!\n\n\n\nIn the plots so far, I kept the country names on the y-axis. However, I would prefer to use the actual names of the ferris wheel and replace the country names with flags. We’ll continue with the ggimage package, which contains a geom_flag() function. The package expects country codes (e.g. NL, US), so we need to transform the names by hand using the countrycodes package.\n\n# Create the country labels from the country names\ndata$code &lt;- countrycode::countrycode(data$country, origin = \"country.name\", destination = \"iso2c\") \n\n# Sort the factor levels of the 'name' variable alphabetically *by country* (the combination of arrange and fct_inorder does that, there are surely smarter ways)\ndata &lt;- data |&gt; arrange(country)\ndata$name &lt;- fct_inorder(factor(data$name))\n\n# Create the graph again from scratch because instead of mapping the country to the y axis, I now\n# map the name to the y axis. Again, surely there are smarter ways to do that...\n# I also move the flags a bit to the left of the x axis and expand the limits of the plot accordingly.\np2 &lt;- \n  ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(name), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(name), yend = fct_rev(name), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", \n               position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)),\n                      position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25,\n                                                x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)),\n                      size = data$size * 1.5) +\n  ggimage::geom_flag(x = -70, aes(image = code)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       title = \"How far do you travel during one rotation in the largest ferris wheels?\",\n       caption = \"Data from ferriswheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-50, 800)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks fine. The main headache in the code chunk above was replacing the mapping of the y axis to show the name (and not the country) and correcting the ordering of the observations.\n\n\n\nI am happy with how the flags and ferris wheels turned out and am now ready to go back to the to-do list from the beginning with some minor things to clean up the graph. This is a playful challenge and ferris wheels are fun, so let’s go for a very light pinkish background colour. I am also adding a text box (using the ggtext package) to use my bicycle wheel as an example to show just how big these ferris wheels are.\n\n\nCode\nturns &lt;- pull(round(data[which(data$diameter == max(data$diameter)), \"diameter\"] / data[data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", \"diameter\"]))\ndata$name &lt;- fct_relevel(data$name, \"Philipp's bike wheel\")\n\np3 &lt;- \n  ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(name), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(name), yend = fct_rev(name), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", alpha = 0.5,\n               position = position_nudge(y = -0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)),\n                      position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25,\n                                                x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)),\n                      size = data$size * 1.5) +\n  ggimage::geom_flag(x = -70, aes(image = code)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       title = \"How far do you travel with one rotation of the largest wheels in the world?\",\n       caption = \"Visualization by Philipp Kollenda / @pkollenda .

I will now hop on my bicycle and think of the Golden Gate Flyer… approximately every 1045 (bike) wheel turn."

    "text": "Defining custom colors and palettes\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\npenguins &lt;- palmerpenguins::penguins\n\nThese examples use the penguins data set from the wonderful palmerpenguins package. Let’s imagine that you work for Penguin Corp and regularly create reports and visualizations with various penguin-related data. Penguin Corp has a style guide that specifies the colors and palettes that should be used, and while you can always specify the colors manually in ggplot2 visualizations, it’s much easier to define the colors and palettes and then reference them through your own scale_fill and scale_color functions. (These are all functions that can be dropped easily into an internal package!)\nFirst, start by defining the various colors you need.\n\npenguin_corp_color &lt;- function(...) {\n\n  penguin_corp_colors &lt;- c(\n    `pink`     = \"#F7B1AB\",\n    `lavender` = \"#807182\",\n    `gray`     = \"#E3DDDD\",\n    `brown`    = \"#A45C3D\",\n    `purple`   = \"#1C0221\")\n\n  cols &lt;- c(...)\n\n  if (is.null(cols))\n    return (penguin_corp_colors)\n\n  penguin_corp_colors[cols]\n}\n\nThat function can be used to show the definition of a specific color:\n\npenguin_corp_color(\"lavender\")\n\n lavender \n\"#807182\" \n\n\nThat penguin_corp_color function then becomes the base of the penguin_corp_palette function below, where those defined colors are combined into palettes. Your organization might have primary and secondary palettes, or palettes designed for specific uses, but here we’ll define a main palette as well as a highlight palette for when we want just two colors.\n\npenguin_corp_palette &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", ...) {\n\n  penguin_corp_palettes &lt;- list(\n    `main` = penguin_corp_color(\"lavender\", \"gray\", \"pink\", \"brown\"),\n    \n    `highlight` = penguin_corp_color(\"purple\", \"gray\")\n  )\n\n  penguin_corp_palettes[[palette]]\n\n}\n\n\npenguin_corp_palette(\"main\")\n\n lavender      gray      pink     brown \n\"#807182\" \"#E3DDDD\" \"#F7B1AB\" \"#A45C3D\" \n\n\nThe show_col function from the scales package is a nifty way to showcase all the colors available in a given palette:\n\nscales::show_col(penguin_corp_palette(\"main\"), cex_label = 2)"

    "text": "Creating your own scale_color and scale_fill functions\nHaving the colors and palettes defined is a great first step, but you can go even further and apply those into your own scale_fill and scale_color functions. The first step is a helper function, here called palette_gen. This function has two arguments, the name of the palette (“main” will be our default) and the direction (so you can flip the scale if necessary), and essentially creates another function that will be used in the scale_fill and scale_color functions. (The n there refers to the number of colors that would be needed for a particular plot.)\n\npalette_gen &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1) {\n\n  function(n) {\n\n    if (n &gt; length(penguin_corp_palette(palette)))\n      warning(\"Not enough colors in this palette!\")\n\n    else {\n\n      all_colors &lt;- penguin_corp_palette(palette)\n\n      all_colors &lt;- unname(unlist(all_colors))\n\n      all_colors &lt;- if (direction &gt;= 0) all_colors else rev(all_colors)\n\n      color_list &lt;- all_colors[1:n]\n\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe function above is for discrete color scales. If you also want to use continuous color scales, the function below uses the existing colorRampPalette function to interpolate the necessary colors between the ones you have chosen in your palette.\n\npalette_gen_c &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1, ...) {\n\n  pal &lt;- penguin_corp_palette(palette)\n\n  pal &lt;- if (direction &gt;= 0) pal else rev(pal)\n\n  colorRampPalette(pal, ...)\n\n}\n\nWith that helper function created, you can write the actual functions to be used with ggplot2. I’ve called mine scale_fill_penguin, which takes the same two arguments as before: palette and direction.\n\nscale_fill_penguin &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1, ...) {\n\n  ggplot2::discrete_scale(\n    \"fill\", \"penguin\",\n    palette_gen(palette, direction),\n    ...\n  )\n}\n\nYou can use the same syntax for scale_color. (Fun fact: I learned from Garrick’s post that the ggplot2 convention is to create a scale_colour function and then replicate it as scale_color.)\n\nscale_colour_penguin &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1, ...) {\n\n  ggplot2::discrete_scale(\n    \"colour\", \"penguin\",\n    palette_gen(palette, direction),\n    ...\n  )\n}\n\nscale_color_penguin &lt;- scale_colour_penguin\n\nAgain, those are for discrete color scales. If you need a continuous scale, use a function like this:\n\nscale_color_penguin_c &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1, ...) {\n\n  pal &lt;- palette_gen_c(palette = palette, direction = direction)\n\n  scale_color_gradientn(colors = pal(256), ...)\n\n}"

    "text": "blog and talks folders\nBoth of these folders contain an index.qmd file to specify the YAML options of the landing page, which lists all of the blog posts or talks. Here’s what mine looks like in the talks folder:\ntitle: &lt;p class=\"center-text\"&gt;Talks&lt;/p&gt;\nauthor: \"\"\ncomments: false\nlisting:\n  contents: \"index.qmd\"\n  sort: \"date desc\"\n  type: \"default\"\n  date-format: \"iso\"\n  fields: [image, date, title, subtitle, author, summary, description, slides, extsite, repo]  \n  page-size: 6\n  template: talk-listing.ejs\npage-layout: full\ntitle-block-banner: true\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: talks.css\nThe listing section specifies which files should be included on the listings page: anything titled index.qmd in the folder and subfolders will get a listing. Mine are sorted descending by date, with six items per page, and I specify the layout of the page with the talk-listing.ejs file.\n\nListing templates\nControlling the look of my listing pages was the hardest part of the entire process! I don’t love the look of a standard listing page, but it was tough figuring out how to make changes. Quarto has some documentation on creating custom listings pages, but you need to create an EJS template, which I wasn’t familiar with. Per the documentation: EJS templates allow you to generate HTML using plain javascript, making it easy to loop through items and output their values in your custom HTML.\nNormally, I would start with the code of the standard/default option and tinker around until I figured out how to change the elements I wanted. But the Quarto default templates were more complex than I needed and didn’t serve as a great starting point. So I went to option number two: adapt the work of people who know more than I do. I looked at lots of Quarto websites—specifically, lots of Quarto listings pages—in an attempt to find something custom that I liked well enough to use as a starting point. I liked the publications page of the AffCom lab at KU as well as the talks page on Andrew Heiss’s site. Looking at those templates (here and here) was enough to get me started.\nThe template for my blog is pretty simple with the title of the post, the publication date floated to the right, the categories, and the summary. The template for my talks page is similar but also includes buttons for any talk-related links I have like slides, a website, or a repo. The template files pull out the correct elements in the appropriate order from the YAML options of the index.qmd files, and then my .css pages create the style that I want for those listings.\n\n\nMetadata files\nIncluding a _metadata.yml file in both my blog and talks folder is useful to specify YAML options that should apply to all of the index.qmd files within those folders. This way I don’t have to, for example, add my name as the author in each file or specify my css file or customize my table of contents each time I write a blog post.\n# Date format\ndate-format: \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\n# Enable banner style title blocks\ntitle-block-banner: \"#1F2041\"\n\n# Add blog-post class to the banner header area\nformat: \n  html:\n    css: blog.css\n    knitr:\n      opts_chunk:\n        dev: png\n        dev.args:\n          bg: transparent\n\n# Default for table of contents\ntoc: true\ntoc-title: CONTENTS\ntoc-location: left\n\nfreeze: true\n\n# Default author\nauthor:\n  - name: Meghan Hall\n\n\nChanging metadata labels\nThis was one of those little things that fell into the “not necessary but would be nice” category. The standard metadata labels for author and date look like so:\n\nThis worked nicely for my blog posts, but for my talk pages, I wanted it to look more like the following:\n\nI almost gave up more than once on this change since it was such a small detail, but I figured it out! And maybe there’s a simpler way to achieve this, but I supplied my own title-block.html file in the talks directory to more clearly specify the output of that title block.\nI created my file based on my own website’s generated html for a blog post (which you can access on Chrome by right-clicking and selecting View Page Source), plus the standard Quarto title-block.html file."

When using blogdown, it was easy to drop all of that content into a static folder that you could link to from the root of your website.\nBut where should those files live within the Quarto structure? Netlify builds your Quarto site from the _site directory, but that directory rebuilds when you rerender your site. Google came to the rescue, and I followed Garrick Aden-Buie’s advice to write a little post-render script.\nThe post-render section of my _quarto.yml code instructs Quarto to copy everything in my static folder over to the _site folder after everything has finished rendering.\nproject:\n  type: website\n  render:\n    - \"blog/**/*.qmd\"\n    - \"talks/**/*.qmd\"\n    - \"index.qmd\"\n    - \"blog/index.qmd\"\n    - \"talks/index.qmd\"\n    - \"404.qmd\"\n  post-render:\n    - \"cp -r static/. _site/\"\nThe period after static/ is important because I want those files (most of which are contained in a slides directory) to be copied directly over to the root of my website in the _site folder without the static folder itself.

    "text": "Yes, this means LaTeX\nSimilarly to how Quarto uses reveal.js to make HTML presentations, Quarto uses LaTeX to make PDF documents. Part of the beauty of Quarto is that you don’t need to learn LaTeX—you can create great PDFs without it. But just like I enjoy learning more about CSS to customize my Quarto HTML products, I enjoy learning more about LaTex to customize my PDF products!\nStandard disclaimer: I am not a LaTeX expert! The tips I offer below are certainly not the only solutions, and depending on your particular use cases they may not be the best solutions. But I think they are useful for someone getting their feet wet with LaTeX and learning how to use LaTeX elements to customize the look of their Quarto PDFs.\nLet’s review how things work structurally: Quarto documents start with a YAML header. Below is the YAML header for this PDF.\n---\nformat: \n  pdf: \n    mainfont: \"Avenir\"\n    sansfont: \"Avenir\"\n    geometry:\n      - top=0.75in\n      - right=0.75in\n      - bottom=0.75in\n      - left=0.75in\n      - heightrounded\n    number-sections: true\n    include-in-header: \n      - \"penguin-header.tex\"\n    toc: false\neditor: source\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  echo: false\nparams:\n  species: 'Adelie'\n  year: 2009\n---\nYou’ll see that the include-in-header option references a penguin-header.tex file. You can include raw LaTeX directly in the body of your Quarto document, which we’ll incorporate below, and/or you can reference LaTeX files (that’s the .tex extension) that can be executed before your Quarto document (as part of what’s known as the LaTeX preamble). Having a file like this is handy whether you want to customize an entire header page (resources on that available below) or to specify a few LaTeX packages and commands before you get into your Quarto document.\nThis is the content of our penguin-header.tex file:\n\\let\\paragraph\\oldparagraph\n\\let\\subparagraph\\oldsubparagraph\n\n\\usepackage{xcolor}\n\\usepackage{titlesec}\n\\usepackage[parfill=0pt]{parskip}\n\\usepackage{fontspec}\n\n\\setsansfont{Prompt}[\n    Path=Prompt/,\n    Scale=0.9,\n    Extension = .ttf,\n    UprightFont=*-Regular,\n    BoldFont=*-Bold,\n    ItalicFont=*-Italic,\n    ]\n\n\\definecolor{Chinstrap}{HTML}{C25BCC}\n\\definecolor{Gentoo}{HTML}{047075}\n\\definecolor{Adelie}{HTML}{FF6600}\n\n\\titleformat{\\section}\n  {\\sffamily\\Large\\bfseries}{\\thesection}{1em}{}[{\\titlerule[0.8pt]}]\nYou specify LaTeX packages like \\usepackage{xcolor}. Here, we’re adding a package to help us define custom colors, a package for custom fonts, and a package to help make nifty section headers."

For the example below, I downloaded the Prompt font and added the following code to my penguin-header.tex file. This is setting my sans serif font to Prompt.\n\\setsansfont{Prompt}[\n    Path=Prompt/,\n    Scale=0.9,\n    Extension = .ttf,\n    UprightFont=*-Regular,\n    BoldFont=*-Bold,\n    ItalicFont=*-Italic,\n    ]\nAnd then the command \\sffamily is the first line (below the YAML) in my Quarto document and states that I want to use the font I specified in the penguin-header.tex file.

The penguin-header.tex file defines a color for each penguin species—Chinstrap, Adelie, and Gentoo—that we can use to render different colors depending on which parameter value of species we select.\nBut how to connect the custom-defined color to our parameter so that the right one is used?\nIn an R code block, you can refer to your report parameters with params$species. If you want to reference these parameters in the Quarto text, enclose like so: `r params$species`. And what’s so neat about Quarto is that you can use this inline code as part of the LaTeX code. So the following command will set the text color to the custom color we defined based on the species determined via the parameter: \\color{`r params$species`}. If our parameter selects the Adelie species, then that piece of code will evaluate as \\color{Adelie} and our orange-y #FF6600 will be used. If you want to set the color back to black, use \\color{black}."

    "text": "Rendering parameterized reports\nThere are three ways to render this type of parameterized report using Quarto. In increasing order of complexity (and usefulness!):\nFirst. Manually change the parameter values in the header YAML of your .qmd file and hit Render in RStudio. This will create a PDF file in the same directory as your .qmd file with the same name as your .qmd file but with a .pdf extension. This is great for one-offs or for testing!\nSecond. If you prefer to work in the terminal, you can use the following command: quarto render penguins.qmd -P species:'Adelie' -P year:'2009'\nThird. For this palmerpenguins data, we have potentially nine separate PDF reports to create: three years for three species. That’s a little annoying to do via the first two methods, and you can imagine how really annoying it could get if you had even more parameter combinations. Thankfully, we can leverage the quarto::quarto_render() function in R to automatically create a report for each parameter combination we want and name that file in a way that we specify.\nrunpdfs &lt;- function(species, year) {\n  quarto::quarto_render(\n    \"penguins.qmd\",\n    output_format = \"pdf\",\n    execute_params = list(species = species, year = year),\n    output_file = glue::glue(\"{species} {year}.pdf\")\n  )\n}\n\npurrr::map2(unique(penguins$species), unique(penguins$year), \n            runpdfs)\nThe first chunk of code defines a new function called runpdfs that is based on the quarto::quarto_render() function. The two arguments to runpdfs are the two Quarto report parameters we have: species and year. Those arguments are used in the execute_params argument to specify the parameter values to Quarto and in the output_file argument to specify the name of the files.\nThe second chunk of code uses map2() from purrr to iteratively run that new function, runpdfs, for every unique combination of species and year from the penguins data set.\nThe code above will result in nine PDF files. The two available examples are Adelie 2009.pdf and Gentoo 2007.pdf."

To optimize the climate benefits of the program, we developed the Washington Climate Smart Estimator {WaCSE} using R and Shiny.\nIntegrating national climate models and datasets, this intuitive, regionally specific user interface allows farmers and policymakers to compare the climate benefits of different agricultural practices across Washington’s diverse counties and farm sizes. Users can explore GHG estimates in interactive tables and plots, download results in spreadsheets and figures, and generate PDF reports.

Here, we give short reproducible examples on how to download and visualize spatial data that can be useful in different settings. More extended examples and details about the capabilities of each of the packages can be seen at the packages’ websites and the rspatialdata website which provides a collection of tutorials on R packages to download and visualize spatial data using R."

Several R packages have been recently developed as clients for various databases that can be used for easy access to spatial data including administrative boundaries, climatic, and OpenStreetMap data. Here, we give short reproducible examples on how to download and visualize spatial data that can be useful in different settings. More extended examples and details about the capabilities of each of the packages can be seen at the packages’ websites and the rspatialdata website which provides a collection of tutorials on R packages to download and visualize spatial data using R."

This should reveal one more pane.\n\nBefore we go any further, we will rearrange these panes to improve the usability of the interface.\n\n\nThen under Pane Layout, adjust the pane arrangement. The arrangement we recommend is shown below.\n\n\n\nAt the top left pane is the Source tab, and at the top right pane, you should have the Console tab.\nThen at the bottom left pane, no tab options should checked—this section should be left empty, with the drop-down saying just “TabSet”.\nFinally, at the bottom right pane, you should check the following tabs: Environment, History, Files, Plots, Packages, Help and Viewer.\n\n\nFirst, open a new script under the File menu if one is not yet open: File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. In the script, type the following:\n\nprint(\"excited for R!\")\n\n\nTo run code, place your cursor anywhere in the code, then hit Control + Enter on Windows.\nThis should send the code to the Console and run it.\n\n\nYou can also run multiple lines at once.\n\nprint(\"excited for R!\")\nprint(\"and RStudio!\")\n\n\nNow drag your cursor to highlight both lines and press Control + Enter.\nTo run the entire script, you can use Control + A to select all code, then press `Control + Enter.\n\n\n\nTo open the script in a new window, click on the third icon in the toolbar directly above the script.\n\n\n\nTo put the window back, click on the same button on the now-external window.\nNext, save the script. Hit Control + S to bring up the Save dialog box.\n\n\n\nConsole\n\nThe console, at the bottom left, is where code is executed. You can type code directly here, but it will not be saved.\nType a random piece of code (maybe a calculation like 3 + 3) and press ‘Enter’.\n\n\n\nIf you place your cursor on the last line of the console, and you press the up arrow, you can go back to the last code that was run. Keep pressing it to cycle to the previous lines.\nTo run any of these previous lines, press Enter.\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\nAt the top right of the RStudio Window, you should see the Environment tab.\nThe Environment tab shows datasets and other objects that are loaded into R’s working memory, or “workspace”.\nTo explore this tab, let’s import a dataset into your environment from R.\nType the code below into your script and run it:\n\n\ndata &lt;- iris\n\nYou have now imported the dataset and stored it in an object named data. (You could have named the object anything you want.)\n\nNow that the dataset is stored by R, you should be able to see it in the Environment pane.\nIf you click on the blue drop-down icon beside the object’s name in the Environment tab to reveal a summary.\n\n\n\nTry clicking directly on the data dataset from the Environment tab. This opens it in a ‘View’ tab.\n\n\n\nThe broom icon, at the top of the Environment pane is used to clear your workspace.\n\n\n\nYou can also remove an object from the workspace with the rm() function.\nType and run the following in a new line on your R script.\n\n\nrm(data)\n\nNotice that the data object no longer shows up in your environment after having run that code.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nNext, the History tab shows previous commands you have run.\n\n\n\nYou can click a line to highlight it, then send it to the console or to your script with the “To Console” and “To Source” icons at the top of this tab.\nTo select multiple lines, use the “Shift-click” method: click the first item you want to select, then hold down the “Shift” key and click the last item you want to select.\nFinally, notice that there is a search bar at the top right of the History pane where you can search for past commands that you have run.\n\n\n\n\nFiles\n\nNext, the Files tab.

And packages with a checkmark are packages which are loaded in the current session."

    "section": "When the target population is ill-defined",
    "text": "When the target population is ill-defined\n\nSometimes the conditions for probability sampling are violated because of loose criteria for defining the target population that the survey is intended to cover.\nFor example, the desired target population may be all households nationwide.\nYet, when the survey is designed and/or implemented, often certain population subgroups such as nomadic households, boat people, and populations in whole areas that are inaccessible owing to the difficult terrain are intentionally excluded. In other cases, a target population intended to cover a restricted, special population such as ever-married women or young people under age 25 excludes important subgroups for various reasons. For example, a target population intended to cover youth under age 25 may exclude those who are in the military or in jail or are otherwise institutionalized.\n\n\nWhenever the actual target population covered by the survey differs from the one intended, the survey team should take care to redefine the target population more accurately. This is important not only to clarify the survey results for users but also to meet the conditions of probability sampling. In the aforementioned example of youth under age 25, the target population should be more precisely described and redefined as civilian, non-institutional youth under age 25. Otherwise, survey coverage should be expanded to include the excluded subgroups.\nThus, it is important to define the target population very carefully so as to cover only those members who will actually be given the chance of being selected for the survey. In cases where subgroups are intentionally excluded, it is of course crucial to apply probability methods to the actual population constituting the frame of the survey. Furthermore, it is incumbent upon the survey directors to clearly describe to the users, when results are released, which segments of the population have been included and which segments were excluded by the survey. Non-probability sampling methods There is no statistical theory, like that for probability sampling, to guide the use of non-probability samples. They can be assessed only through subjective evaluation. Failure to use probability techniques means, the survey estimates will be biased. Moreover, the magnitude of these biases and often their direction towards underestimation or overestimation will be unknown. The precision of sampling estimates, that is, to say their standard errors, can be estimated when probability sampling is used. This is necessary in order for the user to gauge the reliability of the survey estimates and to construct confidence intervals around the latter. In spite of their theoretical deficiencies, non-probability samples are frequently used in various settings and situations. The justification offered by practitioners is generally one based on cost, convenience or even the survey team’s apprehension that a “random” sample may not properly represent the target population."

    "text": "Magnitudes of survey estimates\n\nIn household surveys, every estimate (indicator) to be generated from the survey requires a different sample size for reliable measurement.\nThe size of the sample depends on the size of the estimate, that is to say, its expected proportion of the total population. For example, to estimate reliably the proportion of households with access to safe water requires a different sample size than estimating the proportion of adults not currently working.\nThe expressions for calculating a sample sizes are based on a probabilistic statements, that the true population parameter be contained in an interval with a given probability (confidence level).\nThe width (or precision) of the interval depends on the population variance; on the degree of confidence and on the sample size.\nIn general, the greater the population heterogeneity or the desired confidence level, the wider the interval.\nOn the other hand, the width of the interval will decrease as the sample size increases.\nIn practice, the survey itself can have only one sample size.\nTo calculate the sample size, a choice must be made from among the many estimates to be measured in the survey. For example, if the key estimate was the unemployment rate, calculation of the sample size would be based on it.\nWhen there are many key indicators, a convention sometimes applied is to calculate the sample size needed for each and then use the one that yields the largest sample.\nGenerally, this is the indicator for which the base population is the smallest “sub-target population”, in terms of its proportion of the total population.\nThe desired precision must of course be taken into account. When the sample size is based on such an estimate, each of the other key estimates will be measured with the same or greater reliability.\nAlternatively, the sample size can be based on a comparatively small proportion of the target population instead of on the specification of a particular indicator.\nThis may likely be the best approach in a general-purpose household survey that focuses on several unrelated subjects, in which case it may be impractical or imprudent to base the sample size on an indicator that pertains to a single subject. Target population\nSample size depends also on the target population that will be covered by the survey. Like indicators, there are often several target populations in household surveys.\nA health survey, for example, may target households, to assess access to safe water and sanitation, all persons, to estimate chronic and acute conditions, women aged 14 49, for reproductive health indicators and children under age 5, for anthropometric measurements of height and weight. Calculation of the sample size must therefore take into consideration each of the target populations. However, household surveys frequently have multiple target populations, each of equal interest for the measurement objectives of the survey. It is again, viable, to focus on the smallest one in determining the sample size. For example, if children under age 5 are an important target group for the survey, the sample size should be based on that group."

    "text": "Precision and statistical confidence\n\nSample size determination critically, depends on the degree of precision desired for the indicators.\nThe more precise or reliable the survey estimates must be, the bigger the sample size must be and by orders of magnitude.\nSimilarly, the sample size increases as the degree of statistical confidence desired increases to maintain a given precision.\nThe 95 percent confidence level is almost universally taken as the standard and the sample size necessary to achieve it is calculated accordingly. Taking account of the indicators, a convention in many well-conceived surveys is to use, as the precision requirement, a margin of relative error of 10 percent at the 95 percent confidence level on the key indicators to be estimated, meaning that the standard error of a key indicator should be no greater than 5 percent of the estimate itself. This is calculated as (2 * 0.05x, where x is the survey estimate). For example, if the estimated proportion of persons in the labour force is 65 percent, its standard error should be no larger than 3.25 percentage points, that is, 0.65 multiplied by 0.05. Two times 0.0325, or 0.065, is the relative margin of error at the 95 percent confidence level.\nThe sample size needed to achieve the criterion of 10 percent margin of relative error is thus one-fourth as big as one where the margin of relative error is set at 5 percent. A margin of relative error of 20 percent is generally regarded as the maximum allowable for important indicators (though we do not recommend it). This is because the confidence interval surrounding estimates with greater error tolerances is too wide for meaningful results to be achieved for most analytical or policy needs. In general, we recommend 5 to 10 percent relative errors for the main indicators, budget permitting."

    "text": "Clustering effects\n\nThe degree to which a household survey sample is clustered affects the reliability or precision of the estimates and therefore the sample size.\nCluster effects in household surveys arise from the penultimate sampling units, generally referred to as the “clusters”, which may be villages or city blocks, the sample households, the size and/ or variability of the clusters and from the method of sampling households within the selected clusters.\nClustering as well as the effects of stratification can be measured numerically by the design effect, or deff, which expresses how much larger the sampling variance (square of the standard error) for the stratified cluster sample is compared to a simple random sample of the same size.\nStratification tends to decrease the sampling variance but only to a small degree. By contrast, clustering increases the variance considerably. Therefore, deff indicates primarily how much clustering there is in the survey sample.\nEfficient sample design requires that clusters be used to control costs but also that the design effect be kept as low as possible for the results to be usable and reliable.\nUnfortunately, deff is not known before a survey is undertaken and can be estimated only afterwards from the data themselves.\nIn cases where previous surveys have been conducted or where similar ones have been conducted in other countries, the deff values from those surveys might be used as proxies in the calculation formula to estimate sample size.\n\nTo keep the design effect as low as possible, the sample design should follow these general principles: Use as many clusters as is feasible; Use the smallest cluster size in terms of number of households that is feasible; Use a constant cluster size rather than a variable one; Select a systematic sample of households at the last stage, geographically dispersed, rather than a segment of geographically contiguous households. Thus, for a sample of 12,000 households, it is preferable to select 600 clusters of 20 households each rather than 400 clusters of 30 households each. The sampling design effect is much lower in the former case. Moreover, deff is reduced if the households are chosen systematically from all the households in the cluster rather than selected in contiguous geographical subsegments. When these rules of thumb are followed, the design effect is likely to be reasonably low."

In general, when a proportion p is included, the estimation formula for the sample size, nh, is n_h = z^2 r(1-r)(f)(k)/(p n ̃e^2 , where nh is the parameter to be calculated and is the sample size in terms of number of households to be selected; z is the statistic that defines the level of confidence desired; r is an estimate of a key indicator to be measured by the survey; f is the sample design effect, deff, assumed to be 2.0 (default value); k is a multiplier required to account for the anticipated rate of non response; p is the proportion of the total population accounted for by the target population and upon which the parameter r is based; n ̃ is the average household size (number of persons per household); and e is the margin of error to be attained. Recommended values for some of the parameters are as follows. The z statistic to be used should be 1.96 for the 95%CI The default value, of the sample design effect, is usually set at 2.0 unless there is supporting empirical data from previous or related surveys that suggest a different value. The non-response multiplier, k, should be chosen to reflect the country’s own experience with non response—typically under 10%.\nThe parameter p can usually be calculated from the results of the most recent census. For the margin of error, e, it is recommended that the level of precision be set at 10 percent of r; thus e = 0.10r. A smaller sample size can be obtained with a less stringent margin of error, e = 0.15r, but the survey results would of course be much less reliable. Substituting some selected values gives a reduced formula.\n\nThe following example entails a smaller base population—children under age 5. Example In country X, the main survey indicator is determined to be the mortality rate among children under age 5, thought to be about 5 percentage points. In this case, r = 0.05, and p is estimated to be about 0.15, or 0.035. Again, we wish to estimate the mortality rate with a 10 percent margin of relative error: then e = 0.10r (or 0.005 standard error). The values for the expected non-response rate, design effect, and average household size are again the ones we have recommended. Formula gives nearly 10,704 households (84.50.95)/(0.05*0.15), a much larger sample size than that of the previous example. Again, the primary reason for this is related to the size of the base population, that is, to say children under age 5, who constitute only 15% of the total. The estimated parameter r is also small and this and a small p combine to force a large sample size. The final example is for a case where the total population is the target population. In that case, p = 1 and can be ignored; however, formulae (3.8) and (3.9) may be still used if the recommended values of the parameters are utilized. Example In country D, the main survey indicator is determined to be the proportion of persons in the entire population who had an acute health condition during the preceding week. That propor tion is thought to be between 5 and 10 per cent, in which case the smaller value is used because n r h = - ( . 84 5 1 ) ( )/( ) r p ( ). (3.9)"
