    "title": "How far does that ferris wheel roll?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What I love about data visualization is how it combines creative thinking (what do I want to show?) with technical programming skills (how do I show this?). Nowhere do you combine these two things as elegantly as in the weekly tidy tuesday challenges. Here, data wizards around the word play and practice with fascinating datasets from chocolate bar ratings to the mobility of ERASMUS students to – this week – data on ferris wheels around the world.1 As someone who goes pale in any kind of rollercoaster, ferris wheels feel just about advantageous enough to start my own tidy tuesday journey.\n\n\n\nBefore opening R, I think about what I find fascinating about the topic and what I want to convey with my visualization. Here I am sticking to some descriptive analysis and won’t overthink it, so let’s just go with one of the first thing that came to my mind… ferris wheels are really big!\n\nIf a ferris wheel would be an actual wheel, how far would it travel during one rotation?2\n\nThe message gives me part of the structure for the visualization. Here, I want to select a few examples from different countries and show the diameter on the x-axis. I’ve created a lot of horizontal bar charts for a consultancy this summer, so naturally this is my starting point.\nA great thing about these just-for-fun challenges is that you can use them to add 1-2 new skills to your visualization toolbox. For this challenge I want to learn two things:\n\nHow do I add icons (ferris wheels 🎡, obviously) instead of dots in the chart?\nHow do I add country flags on the y-axis.\n\nI don’t want to spend the entire evening on this, so I think it is important to limit myself to only these two new features. I will also concentrate on them and not care too much (yet) about other things, like titles, background, themes, etc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBecause this isn’t a mystery novel, I am giving away how the visualization will look like in the end. Don’t click if you want to keep the suspense…\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these initial thoughts out of the way, I can roughly sketch the visualization process and outline of this post.\n\nA first look at the data. Choose which points to show.\nCreate the simplest graph that shows the intended message.\nAdd the ferris wheel icons.\nAdd the country flags.\nClean up the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s first install the necessary packages and load and save the data.\n#install.packages(c(\"tidytuesdayR\", \"tidyverse\", \"here\", \"ggimage\", \"countrycode\", \"ggtext\"))\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n#data &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2022-08-09\")$wheels\n#write_rds(data, here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"data\", \"wheels\"))\ndata &lt;- read_rds(here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"data\", \"wheels\"))\n\n\n\nThe entire dataset collects 22 variables on 73 ferris wheels in 26 different countries. This is way to much information to display, so let’s keep only a handful of ferris wheels and only information on their name, country, height and diameter.\n\ndata &lt;- data |&gt; \n  select(country, name, height, diameter) |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt; \n  filter(height == max(height, na.rm = T),\n         country %in% c(\"Austria\", \"Canada\", \"China\", \"Mexico\", \"UK\", \"USA\")) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(across(c(height, diameter), round, 0),\n         country = factor(country))\n\nThis is the data that we will use. As a comparison, I will add data from a more typical wheel: my dutch bicycle wheel.\n\ndata &lt;- bind_rows(data, tibble(country = \"Netherlands\", name = \"Philipp's bike wheel\", height = 0.67, diameter = 0.67))\nknitr::kable(data)\n\n\n\n\ncountry\nname\nheight\ndiameter\n\n\n\n\nChina\nBeijing Great Wheel\n693.00\n643.00\n\n\nUSA\nGolden Gate Flyer\n728.00\n700.00\n\n\nUK\nLondon Eye\n443.00\n394.00\n\n\nCanada\nNiagara SkyWheel\n175.00\n167.00\n\n\nMexico\nStar of Puebla\n262.00\n229.00\n\n\nAustria\nWiener Riesenrad\n212.00\n200.00\n\n\nNetherlands\nPhilipp’s bike wheel\n0.67\n0.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(country), x = diameter)) + \n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       # x = \"Diameter of the highest ferris wheel in the country (in meter)\"\n       title = \"How far do you travel during one rotation in the largest ferris wheels?\",\n       caption = \"Data from ferriswheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 800)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\np +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = country, yend = country, x = 0, xend = diameter), linetype = \"dashed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t pretty, but that’s not the point. Having a bare-minimum working example helps to think about whether the graph type fits and what can be done to emphasise the key message. It also helps to create a to-do list of things to improve: like a different order of ferris wheels, maybe adding an empty row to separate the bike data from the ferris wheel data, a label or subtitle that puts the ferris wheel in relation to the bike wheel, another background color, adding ‘meter’ to the x-axis and more). But let us first tackle the two big learnings that I wanted to get out of the challenge: replacing the dots with icons (now I also need a bike, 🚲) and adding the country flags.\n\n\n\nAs always, there are many ways to Rome. Here I am going with the ggimage package maintained by Guangchuang YU. I have not used this before, but a look at the online vignette makes me hopeful that I can use this for the ferris wheel icons and the country flags 😃\nThere are two ways we can go. The first is to use the ggimage::geom_emoji and to insert the ferris wheel and bicycle emojis that I have used throughout the post. That seems simple, we just need the unicode to pass it to the function. That’s easy to look up at, e.g. https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html.\n\ndata$size = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 0.075, data$diameter / max(data$diameter) * 0.25)\np +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(country), yend = fct_rev(country), x = 0, xend = diameter), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_emoji(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", \"1f6b2\", \"1f3a1\")), position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.3) - 0.25), size = data$size)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks OK. The most complicated part was actually that I wanted to scale the size of the image by the size of the ferris wheel, which required making an extra size column and experimenting a lot with position_nudge to let the dashed line go to the bottom of the icon, not to the middle. But I am not super happy with the emoji’s, so let’s try to download some images of ferris wheels and use those with ggimage::geom_image() instead.\nI’ll first download a simple transparent ferris wheel png file (from here) and use a bike icon (from here).\n\nferris_path &lt;- here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"images\", \"ferriswheel.png\")\nbike_path &lt;- here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"images\", \"bike.png\")\n\np1 &lt;- p +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(country), yend = fct_rev(country), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", \n               position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(\n    aes(image = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)), \n    position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25, \n                              x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)), \n    size = data$size * 1.5)\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m happy with this. Onwards to do the country flags!\n\n\n\nIn the plots so far, I kept the country names on the y-axis. However, I would prefer to use the actual names of the ferris wheel and replace the country names with flags. We’ll continue with the ggimage package, which contains a geom_flag() function. The package expects country codes (e.g. NL, US), so we need to transform the names by hand using the countrycodes package.\n\n# Create the country labels from the country names\ndata$code &lt;- countrycode::countrycode(data$country, origin = \"country.name\", destination = \"iso2c\") \n\n# Sort the factor levels of the 'name' variable alphabetically *by country* (the combination of arrange and fct_inorder does that, there are surely smarter ways)\ndata &lt;- data |&gt; arrange(country)\ndata$name &lt;- fct_inorder(factor(data$name))\n\n# Create the graph again from scratch because instead of mapping the country to the y axis, I now\n# map the name to the y axis. Again, surely there are smarter ways to do that...\n# I also move the flags a bit to the left of the x axis and expand the limits of the plot accordingly.\np2 &lt;- \n  ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(name), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(name), yend = fct_rev(name), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", \n               position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)),\n                      position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25,\n                                                x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)),\n                      size = data$size * 1.5) +\n  ggimage::geom_flag(x = -70, aes(image = code)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       title = \"How far do you travel during one rotation in the largest ferris wheels?\",\n       caption = \"Data from ferriswheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-50, 800)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks fine. The main headache in the code chunk above was replacing the mapping of the y axis to show the name (and not the country) and correcting the ordering of the observations.\n\n\n\nI am happy with how the flags and ferris wheels turned out and am now ready to go back to the to-do list from the beginning with some minor things to clean up the graph. This is a playful challenge and ferris wheels are fun, so let’s go for a very light pinkish background colour. I am also adding a text box (using the ggtext package) to use my bicycle wheel as an example to show just how big these ferris wheels are.\n\n\nCode\nturns &lt;- pull(round(data[which(data$diameter == max(data$diameter)), \"diameter\"] / data[data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", \"diameter\"]))\ndata$name &lt;- fct_relevel(data$name, \"Philipp's bike wheel\")\n\np3 &lt;- \n  ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(name), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(name), yend = fct_rev(name), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", alpha = 0.5,\n               position = position_nudge(y = -0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)),\n                      position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25,\n                                                x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)),\n                      size = data$size * 1.5) +\n  ggimage::geom_flag(x = -70, aes(image = code)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       title = \"How far do you travel with one rotation of the largest wheels in the world?\",\n       caption = \"Visualization by Philipp Kollenda / @pkollenda . Accompanying blog post on my website. \\n Data from ferriswheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  ggtext::geom_textbox(aes(x = 300, y = 6.75, hjust = 0,\n                           label = glue::glue(\"My bike wheel has to &lt;span style='color: red;'&gt;turn {turns} times&lt;/span&gt; to travel the same distance as one rotation with the largest ferris wheel.\")),\n                       fill = \"papayawhip\", width = unit(6, \"cm\"), size = 3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-50, 800), labels = scales::label_number(suffix = \" meter\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\", plot.title = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(size = 20, padding = margin(c(10, 10, 20, 10))),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12)) +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FFFAFA\"))\np3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am happy with how this visualization turned out and glad I learned something about how to insert flags, icons and other images with the ggimage package. I will now hop on my bicycle and think of the Golden Gate Flyer… approximately every 1045 (bike) wheel turn."

    "title": "Build a simple website with R and Quarto in under 30 10 minutes.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I am especially excited about the possibility to quickly build websites (for blogs, teaching, sharing notes, publishing research etc.) with Quarto, without having to leave my R environment where I do all my coding anyways. Let’s get started!\n\nLet’s start by building a very simple website. I have three things on my wishlist:\n\nthe website should have multiple pages,\nan intuitive way to navigate between them and\nshow some images, code and output.\n\nWe won’t worry about hosting yet (that’s for another post) and simply use quarto.pub (more on that below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Here is how to get a website up and running in three steps\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, start a new project and choose Quarto website.\nChange content in the .qmd files and configuration in the .yml file.\nPublish to quarto pub via the terminal.\n\n\n\nHere is the final website https://philipp.quarto.pub/my-first-website But, let’s look at each of the steps in more detail.\n\nStep 1: Create the Quarto website project\nIn RStudio, we create a new project and choose Quarto website from the list of available templates. If that does not show up for you, chances are that you need to update RStudio to the latest version (i.e. RStudio 2022.07.1+554 “Spotted Wakerobin” works).\nA click on create project will create the scaffolding for our new website:\n\nTwo .qmd files that will become pages on our website.\nA .yml file that we use to keep track of the options.\nA styles.css file that we use to customize the appearance of the website1.\n\nIf we click on “Render” (or use Shift + Cmd + K) the document will (hopefully) render and show up in the Viewer pane of RStudio. That’s all and we could already publish this as a functioning website (🥳), but let’s add at least a minimal amount of our own content.\n\n\nStep 2: Changing the content (.qmd) and the structure (.yml) of our website.\nWhen we initialized the project, Quarto graciously already created two .qmd files which will be two pages on our website and a .yml file which records settings about the structure, general options, appearance and so on.\nWe are going to change the default content of the index.qmd file and the name and content of the about.qmd file. To do that, simply open the respective .qmd file and edit what you want to change. We won’t focus here on how to author Quarto documents, but the documentation on https://quarto.org/docs/authoring is amazing. For completeness, I put the code that I used in our website at the bottom of this post.\nNow, ideally we want to see the effects of our changes immediately. There are two options. We can switch on “Render on Save” and see the updated page in RStudios Viewer pane whenever we save. Or – way cooler IMHO – we can preview the entire website by typing quarto preview in the terminal field of RStudio (next to the console, where???).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview a website without publishing it by typing quarto preview in the terminal.\n\n\n\nWhere the .qmd files tell the browser what the website should display, the .yml file tells the browser how to structure the website. This is where you change the design, add pages, choose a logo and so much more. We’ll not go into detail on the site configuration yaml here and just focus on getting a simple website up-and-running, but luckily the Quarto team has you covered.\n\n\nStep 3: Publish your website.\nThis is it! It is time to let our creation leave the confines of the local computer and roam the world wide web. But we need a home address for our website and for the sake of using the simplest possible solution we will publish the website using quarto pub.\nIf you are already signed up and authenticated for Quarto Pub, great! Keep reading below.\n\n\nOtherwise click here to show the details.\n\nIf you still need to make an account, go to the quarto pub website (https://quartopub.com/), click Sign up, confirm your email and choose a username. The username will be in the URL of every website you create, so best to choose something highly professional 🤓.\n\nOnce you created your account (or if you already had one), open https://quartopub.com (this should show an empty profile page if you have not previously created a website) and just keep it open.\nNow comes the magic. Head back to RStudio and type quarto publish quarto-pub in the terminal (termi-WHAT?). If you are logged in to quarto pub in a browser, the terminal will show ? Publish with account:, your email address on the next line and in gray the words Use another account…. Don’t be fooled (like I was). This is not an error message and the console is not trying to tell you to use another account, it’s merely asking… So, confidently press Enter and it will ask about the site name. Press enter again and voilà, Quarto will upload your .qmd and .yml files to quarto pub and publish your website.\nYou (and everyone else!) can now see your website at YOUR-USERNAME.quarto.pub/YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME/. Here is the site that I just created in during this post https://philipp.quarto.pub/my-first-website/.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nStupid mistakes that tripped me up and that you don’t need to repeat.\n\nWhere is the terminal in RStudio?\nIf you do not use the terminal often it is easy to overlook it even though it is hidden in plain sight.  ##### Why does quarto pub ask me a different name / email address… When I first published this site, I diligently typed quarto publish quarto-pub in the terminal and was greeted by the message: “Use a different name…”.\n\n\nI fixed a typo but already published the site, what now?\nDon’t despair, unlike certain social media sites, quarto.pub does come with an edit button. Simply change what you want to change in the .qmd or .yml files and don’t forget to publish again via the termina. The console will ask you if you want to update the already published site… yes, please! That last step is easy to miss though, because RStudio’s Render on Save and Preview make it so easy to expect that everything just updates automatically.\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the index.qmd file.\nNote that I am not actually including the first line, only the part beginning with the yaml dashes (---).\n```{r}\n---\ntitle: \"Welcome to my first website\"\n---\n\nThis is a Quarto website that I created in just a few minutes. Read about it here and find amazing resources on <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.\n\n![](images/screenshot.png)\n```\n\n\nThe content of the about.qmd file.\n---\ntitle: \"Ferries Wheels\"\n---\n\n## Some fun with ferries wheels\n\n```{r}\n#| label: ferries-plot\n#| code-line-numbers: true\n#| code-fold: true\n#| message: false\n# install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\") install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n#data <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2022-08-09\")$wheels\ndata <- read_rds(\"data/wheels\")\nhighest <- data |> \n  group_by(country) |> \n  filter(height == max(height, na.rm = T),\n         country %in% c(\"Canada\", \"China\", \"Mexico\", \"Taiwan\", \"Japan\", \"Philippines\", \"UK\", \"USA\")) |> \n  select(country, height, diameter)\nggplot(highest, aes(y = fct_rev(factor(country)), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = country, yend = country, x = 0, xend = diameter), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       # x = \"Diameter of the highest ferries wheel in the country (in meter)\"\n       title = \"How far do you travel during one rotation in the highest ferries wheels?\",\n       caption = \"Data from ferriewheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 800)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nWe won’t worry about customizing anything yet and the file is empty anyways.↩︎"

What Motivates Impact Investors’ Lending to Firms in Low-Income Countries (Journal of Banking & Finance, 2022 | open-access link)\n\nI analyze 70,000 transactions by retail impact investors on a peer-to-peer lending platform that intermediates loans to firms in low-income countries. Loans pay interest to investors and publicize indicators of expected social impact. Financial returns significantly influence investors’ decisions: a one percentage point increase in the interest rate increases funding speed seven-fold, investment probability two-fold and transaction size by 122 Euro. Expected social impact influences investors’ perception but has no influence (for female empowerment, employees and beneficiaries) or limited influence (for turnover) on investors’ funding decisions. When all available loans pay the same interest rates, female borrowers - but not firms with many employees or beneficiaries - are more likely to be chosen, suggesting that variation in financial returns can crowd out salient dimensions of social impact. The study implies that peer-to-peer lending platforms should function as gatekeepers of social impact and cannot outsource the evaluation of social impact to retail impact investors.\n\n\nI’m excited to share my first-ever publication 🥳At times doing a PhD feels like filling a pool with water one cup at a time and it's difficult to see progress.

    "section": "",
    "text": "What I love about data visualization is how it combines creative thinking (what do I want to show?) with technical programming skills (how do I show this?). Nowhere do you combine these two things as elegantly as in the weekly tidy tuesday challenges. Here, data wizards around the word play and practice with fascinating datasets from chocolate bar ratings to the mobility of ERASMUS students to – this week – data on ferris wheels around the world.1 As someone who goes pale in any kind of rollercoaster, ferris wheels feel just about advantageous enough to start my own tidy tuesday journey.\n\n\n\nBefore opening R, I think about what I find fascinating about the topic and what I want to convey with my visualization. Here I am sticking to some descriptive analysis and won’t overthink it, so let’s just go with one of the first thing that came to my mind… ferris wheels are really big!\n\nIf a ferris wheel would be an actual wheel, how far would it travel during one rotation?2\n\nThe message gives me part of the structure for the visualization. Here, I want to select a few examples from different countries and show the diameter on the x-axis. I’ve created a lot of horizontal bar charts for a consultancy this summer, so naturally this is my starting point.\nA great thing about these just-for-fun challenges is that you can use them to add 1-2 new skills to your visualization toolbox. For this challenge I want to learn two things:\n\nHow do I add icons (ferris wheels 🎡, obviously) instead of dots in the chart?\nHow do I add country flags on the y-axis.\n\nI don’t want to spend the entire evening on this, so I think it is important to limit myself to only these two new features. I will also concentrate on them and not care too much (yet) about other things, like titles, background, themes, etc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBecause this isn’t a mystery novel, I am giving away how the visualization will look like in the end. Don’t click if you want to keep the suspense…\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these initial thoughts out of the way, I can roughly sketch the visualization process and outline of this post.\n\nA first look at the data. Choose which points to show.\nCreate the simplest graph that shows the intended message.\nAdd the ferris wheel icons.\nAdd the country flags.\nClean up the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s first install the necessary packages and load and save the data.\n#install.packages(c(\"tidytuesdayR\", \"tidyverse\", \"here\", \"ggimage\", \"countrycode\", \"ggtext\"))\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n#data &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2022-08-09\")$wheels\n#write_rds(data, here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"data\", \"wheels\"))\ndata &lt;- read_rds(here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"data\", \"wheels\"))\n\n\n\nThe entire dataset collects 22 variables on 73 ferris wheels in 26 different countries. This is way to much information to display, so let’s keep only a handful of ferris wheels and only information on their name, country, height and diameter.\n\ndata &lt;- data |&gt; \n  select(country, name, height, diameter) |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt; \n  filter(height == max(height, na.rm = T),\n         country %in% c(\"Austria\", \"Canada\", \"China\", \"Mexico\", \"UK\", \"USA\")) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(across(c(height, diameter), round, 0),\n         country = factor(country))\n\nThis is the data that we will use.

Having a bare-minimum working example helps to think about whether the graph type fits and what can be done to emphasise the key message. It also helps to create a to-do list of things to improve: like a different order of ferris wheels, maybe adding an empty row to separate the bike data from the ferris wheel data, a label or subtitle that puts the ferris wheel in relation to the bike wheel, another background color, adding ‘meter’ to the x-axis and more). But let us first tackle the two big learnings that I wanted to get out of the challenge: replacing the dots with icons (now I also need a bike, 🚲) and adding the country flags.\n\n\n\nAs always, there are many ways to Rome. Here I am going with the ggimage package maintained by Guangchuang YU. I have not used this before, but a look at the online vignette makes me hopeful that I can use this for the ferris wheel icons and the country flags 😃\nThere are two ways we can go. The first is to use the ggimage::geom_emoji and to insert the ferris wheel and bicycle emojis that I have used throughout the post. That seems simple, we just need the unicode to pass it to the function. That’s easy to look up at, e.g. https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html.\n\ndata$size = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 0.075, data$diameter / max(data$diameter) * 0.25)\np +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(country), yend = fct_rev(country), x = 0, xend = diameter), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_emoji(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", \"1f6b2\", \"1f3a1\")), position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.3) - 0.25), size = data$size)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks OK. The most complicated part was actually that I wanted to scale the size of the image by the size of the ferris wheel, which required making an extra size column and experimenting a lot with position_nudge to let the dashed line go to the bottom of the icon, not to the middle. But I am not super happy with the emoji’s, so let’s try to download some images of ferris wheels and use those with ggimage::geom_image() instead.\nI’ll first download a simple transparent ferris wheel png file (from here) and use a bike icon (from here).\n\nferris_path &lt;- here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"images\", \"ferriswheel.png\")\nbike_path &lt;- here(\"posts\", \"tt2022-08-09_ferriswheels\", \"images\", \"bike.png\")\n\np1 &lt;- p +\n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(country), yend = fct_rev(country), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", \n               position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(\n    aes(image = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)), \n    position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25, \n                              x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)), \n    size = data$size * 1.5)\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m happy with this. Onwards to do the country flags!\n\n\n\nIn the plots so far, I kept the country names on the y-axis. However, I would prefer to use the actual names of the ferris wheel and replace the country names with flags. We’ll continue with the ggimage package, which contains a geom_flag() function. The package expects country codes (e.g. NL, US), so we need to transform the names by hand using the countrycodes package.\n\n# Create the country labels from the country names\ndata$code &lt;- countrycode::countrycode(data$country, origin = \"country.name\", destination = \"iso2c\") \n\n# Sort the factor levels of the 'name' variable alphabetically *by country* (the combination of arrange and fct_inorder does that, there are surely smarter ways)\ndata &lt;- data |&gt; arrange(country)\ndata$name &lt;- fct_inorder(factor(data$name))\n\n# Create the graph again from scratch because instead of mapping the country to the y axis, I now\n# map the name to the y axis. Again, surely there are smarter ways to do that...\n# I also move the flags a bit to the left of the x axis and expand the limits of the plot accordingly.\np2 &lt;- \n  ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(name), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(name), yend = fct_rev(name), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", \n               position = position_nudge(y = - 0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)),\n                      position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25,\n                                                x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)),\n                      size = data$size * 1.5) +\n  ggimage::geom_flag(x = -70, aes(image = code)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       title = \"How far do you travel during one rotation in the largest ferris wheels?\",\n       caption = \"Data from ferriswheel package by Emil Hvitfeldt, #tidytuesday August 2022\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-50, 800)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks fine. The main headache in the code chunk above was replacing the mapping of the y axis to show the name (and not the country) and correcting the ordering of the observations.\n\n\n\nI am happy with how the flags and ferris wheels turned out and am now ready to go back to the to-do list from the beginning with some minor things to clean up the graph. This is a playful challenge and ferris wheels are fun, so let’s go for a very light pinkish background colour. I am also adding a text box (using the ggtext package) to use my bicycle wheel as an example to show just how big these ferris wheels are.\n\n\nCode\nturns &lt;- pull(round(data[which(data$diameter == max(data$diameter)), \"diameter\"] / data[data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", \"diameter\"]))\ndata$name &lt;- fct_relevel(data$name, \"Philipp's bike wheel\")\n\np3 &lt;- \n  ggplot(data, aes(y = fct_rev(name), x = diameter)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(y = fct_rev(name), yend = fct_rev(name), x = 0, xend = diameter),\n               linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\", alpha = 0.5,\n               position = position_nudge(y = -0.25)) +\n  ggimage::geom_image(aes(image = if_else(name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", bike_path, ferris_path)),\n                      position = position_nudge(y = (data$size / 0.27) - 0.25,\n                                                x = if_else(data$name == \"Philipp's bike wheel\", 15, 0)),\n                      size = data$size * 1.5) +\n  ggimage::geom_flag(x = -70, aes(image = code)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\",\n       title = \"How far do you travel with one rotation of the largest wheels in the world?\",\n       caption = \"Visualization by Philipp Kollenda / @pkollenda .

I will now hop on my bicycle and think of the Golden Gate Flyer… approximately every 1045 (bike) wheel turn."

    "text": "Defining custom colors and palettes\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\npenguins &lt;- palmerpenguins::penguins\n\nThese examples use the penguins data set from the wonderful palmerpenguins package. Let’s imagine that you work for Penguin Corp and regularly create reports and visualizations with various penguin-related data. Penguin Corp has a style guide that specifies the colors and palettes that should be used, and while you can always specify the colors manually in ggplot2 visualizations, it’s much easier to define the colors and palettes and then reference them through your own scale_fill and scale_color functions. (These are all functions that can be dropped easily into an internal package!)\nFirst, start by defining the various colors you need.\n\npenguin_corp_color &lt;- function(...) {\n\n  penguin_corp_colors &lt;- c(\n    `pink`     = \"#F7B1AB\",\n    `lavender` = \"#807182\",\n    `gray`     = \"#E3DDDD\",\n    `brown`    = \"#A45C3D\",\n    `purple`   = \"#1C0221\")\n\n  cols &lt;- c(...)\n\n  if (is.null(cols))\n    return (penguin_corp_colors)\n\n  penguin_corp_colors[cols]\n}\n\nThat function can be used to show the definition of a specific color:\n\npenguin_corp_color(\"lavender\")\n\n lavender \n\"#807182\" \n\n\nThat penguin_corp_color function then becomes the base of the penguin_corp_palette function below, where those defined colors are combined into palettes. Your organization might have primary and secondary palettes, or palettes designed for specific uses, but here we’ll define a main palette as well as a highlight palette for when we want just two colors.\n\npenguin_corp_palette &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", ...) {\n\n  penguin_corp_palettes &lt;- list(\n    `main` = penguin_corp_color(\"lavender\", \"gray\", \"pink\", \"brown\"),\n    \n    `highlight` = penguin_corp_color(\"purple\", \"gray\")\n  )\n\n  penguin_corp_palettes[[palette]]\n\n}\n\n\npenguin_corp_palette(\"main\")\n\n lavender      gray      pink     brown \n\"#807182\" \"#E3DDDD\" \"#F7B1AB\" \"#A45C3D\" \n\n\nThe show_col function from the scales package is a nifty way to showcase all the colors available in a given palette:\n\nscales::show_col(penguin_corp_palette(\"main\"), cex_label = 2)"

    "text": "Creating your own scale_color and scale_fill functions\nHaving the colors and palettes defined is a great first step, but you can go even further and apply those into your own scale_fill and scale_color functions. The first step is a helper function, here called palette_gen. This function has two arguments, the name of the palette (“main” will be our default) and the direction (so you can flip the scale if necessary), and essentially creates another function that will be used in the scale_fill and scale_color functions. (The n there refers to the number of colors that would be needed for a particular plot.)\n\npalette_gen &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1) {\n\n  function(n) {\n\n    if (n &gt; length(penguin_corp_palette(palette)))\n      warning(\"Not enough colors in this palette!\")\n\n    else {\n\n      all_colors &lt;- penguin_corp_palette(palette)\n\n      all_colors &lt;- unname(unlist(all_colors))\n\n      all_colors &lt;- if (direction &gt;= 0) all_colors else rev(all_colors)\n\n      color_list &lt;- all_colors[1:n]\n\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe function above is for discrete color scales. If you also want to use continuous color scales, the function below uses the existing colorRampPalette function to interpolate the necessary colors between the ones you have chosen in your palette.\n\npalette_gen_c &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1, ...) {\n\n  pal &lt;- penguin_corp_palette(palette)\n\n  pal &lt;- if (direction &gt;= 0) pal else rev(pal)\n\n  colorRampPalette(pal, ...)\n\n}\n\nWith that helper function created, you can write the actual functions to be used with ggplot2. I’ve called mine scale_fill_penguin, which takes the same two arguments as before: palette and direction.\n\nscale_fill_penguin &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1, ...) {\n\n  ggplot2::discrete_scale(\n    \"fill\", \"penguin\",\n    palette_gen(palette, direction),\n    ...\n  )\n}\n\nYou can use the same syntax for scale_color. (Fun fact: I learned from Garrick’s post that the ggplot2 convention is to create a scale_colour function and then replicate it as scale_color.)\n\nscale_colour_penguin &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1, ...) {\n\n  ggplot2::discrete_scale(\n    \"colour\", \"penguin\",\n    palette_gen(palette, direction),\n    ...\n  )\n}\n\nscale_color_penguin &lt;- scale_colour_penguin\n\nAgain, those are for discrete color scales. If you need a continuous scale, use a function like this:\n\nscale_color_penguin_c &lt;- function(palette = \"main\", direction = 1, ...) {\n\n  pal &lt;- palette_gen_c(palette = palette, direction = direction)\n\n  scale_color_gradientn(colors = pal(256), ...)\n\n}"

Mine are sorted descending by date, with six items per page, and I specify the layout of the page with the talk-listing.ejs file.\n\nListing templates\nControlling the look of my listing pages was the hardest part of the entire process! I don’t love the look of a standard listing page, but it was tough figuring out how to make changes. Quarto has some documentation on creating custom listings pages, but you need to create an EJS template, which I wasn’t familiar with. Per the documentation: EJS templates allow you to generate HTML using plain javascript, making it easy to loop through items and output their values in your custom HTML.\nNormally, I would start with the code of the standard/default option and tinker around until I figured out how to change the elements I wanted. But the Quarto default templates were more complex than I needed and didn’t serve as a great starting point. So I went to option number two: adapt the work of people who know more than I do. I looked at lots of Quarto websites—specifically, lots of Quarto listings pages—in an attempt to find something custom that I liked well enough to use as a starting point. I liked the publications page of the AffCom lab at KU as well as the talks page on Andrew Heiss’s site. Looking at those templates (here and here) was enough to get me started.\nThe template for my blog is pretty simple with the title of the post, the publication date floated to the right, the categories, and the summary. The template for my talks page is similar but also includes buttons for any talk-related links I have like slides, a website, or a repo. The template files pull out the correct elements in the appropriate order from the YAML options of the index.qmd files, and then my .css pages create the style that I want for those listings.\n\n\nMetadata files\nIncluding a _metadata.yml file in both my blog and talks folder is useful to specify YAML options that should apply to all of the index.qmd files within those folders. This way I don’t have to, for example, add my name as the author in each file or specify my css file or customize my table of contents each time I write a blog post.\n# Date format\ndate-format: \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n\n# Enable banner style title blocks\ntitle-block-banner: \"#1F2041\"\n\n# Add blog-post class to the banner header area\nformat: \n  html:\n    css: blog.css\n    knitr:\n      opts_chunk:\n        dev: png\n        dev.args:\n          bg: transparent\n\n# Default for table of contents\ntoc: true\ntoc-title: CONTENTS\ntoc-location: left\n\nfreeze: true\n\n# Default author\nauthor:\n  - name: Meghan Hall\n\n\nChanging metadata labels\nThis was one of those little things that fell into the “not necessary but would be nice” category. The standard metadata labels for author and date look like so:\n\nThis worked nicely for my blog posts, but for my talk pages, I wanted it to look more like the following:\n\nI almost gave up more than once on this change since it was such a small detail, but I figured it out! And maybe there’s a simpler way to achieve this, but I supplied my own title-block.html file in the talks directory to more clearly specify the output of that title block.\nI created my file based on my own website’s generated html for a blog post (which you can access on Chrome by right-clicking and selecting View Page Source), plus the standard Quarto title-block.html file."

When using blogdown, it was easy to drop all of that content into a static folder that you could link to from the root of your website.\nBut where should those files live within the Quarto structure? Netlify builds your Quarto site from the _site directory, but that directory rebuilds when you rerender your site. Google came to the rescue, and I followed Garrick Aden-Buie’s advice to write a little post-render script.\nThe post-render section of my _quarto.yml code instructs Quarto to copy everything in my static folder over to the _site folder after everything has finished rendering.\nproject:\n  type: website\n  render:\n    - \"blog/**/*.qmd\"\n    - \"talks/**/*.qmd\"\n    - \"index.qmd\"\n    - \"blog/index.qmd\"\n    - \"talks/index.qmd\"\n    - \"404.qmd\"\n  post-render:\n    - \"cp -r static/. _site/\"\nThe period after static/ is important because I want those files (most of which are contained in a slides directory) to be copied directly over to the root of my website in the _site folder without the static folder itself.

    "text": "Yes, this means LaTeX\nSimilarly to how Quarto uses reveal.js to make HTML presentations, Quarto uses LaTeX to make PDF documents. Part of the beauty of Quarto is that you don’t need to learn LaTeX—you can create great PDFs without it. But just like I enjoy learning more about CSS to customize my Quarto HTML products, I enjoy learning more about LaTex to customize my PDF products!\nStandard disclaimer: I am not a LaTeX expert! The tips I offer below are certainly not the only solutions, and depending on your particular use cases they may not be the best solutions. But I think they are useful for someone getting their feet wet with LaTeX and learning how to use LaTeX elements to customize the look of their Quarto PDFs.\nLet’s review how things work structurally: Quarto documents start with a YAML header. Below is the YAML header for this PDF.\n---\nformat: \n  pdf: \n    mainfont: \"Avenir\"\n    sansfont: \"Avenir\"\n    geometry:\n      - top=0.75in\n      - right=0.75in\n      - bottom=0.75in\n      - left=0.75in\n      - heightrounded\n    number-sections: true\n    include-in-header: \n      - \"penguin-header.tex\"\n    toc: false\neditor: source\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  echo: false\nparams:\n  species: 'Adelie'\n  year: 2009\n---\nYou’ll see that the include-in-header option references a penguin-header.tex file. You can include raw LaTeX directly in the body of your Quarto document, which we’ll incorporate below, and/or you can reference LaTeX files (that’s the .tex extension) that can be executed before your Quarto document (as part of what’s known as the LaTeX preamble). Having a file like this is handy whether you want to customize an entire header page (resources on that available below) or to specify a few LaTeX packages and commands before you get into your Quarto document.\nThis is the content of our penguin-header.tex file:\n\\let\\paragraph\\oldparagraph\n\\let\\subparagraph\\oldsubparagraph\n\n\\usepackage{xcolor}\n\\usepackage{titlesec}\n\\usepackage[parfill=0pt]{parskip}\n\\usepackage{fontspec}\n\n\\setsansfont{Prompt}[\n    Path=Prompt/,\n    Scale=0.9,\n    Extension = .ttf,\n    UprightFont=*-Regular,\n    BoldFont=*-Bold,\n    ItalicFont=*-Italic,\n    ]\n\n\\definecolor{Chinstrap}{HTML}{C25BCC}\n\\definecolor{Gentoo}{HTML}{047075}\n\\definecolor{Adelie}{HTML}{FF6600}\n\n\\titleformat{\\section}\n  {\\sffamily\\Large\\bfseries}{\\thesection}{1em}{}[{\\titlerule[0.8pt]}]\nYou specify LaTeX packages like \\usepackage{xcolor}. Here, we’re adding a package to help us define custom colors, a package for custom fonts, and a package to help make nifty section headers."

For the example below, I downloaded the Prompt font and added the following code to my penguin-header.tex file. This is setting my sans serif font to Prompt.\n\\setsansfont{Prompt}[\n    Path=Prompt/,\n    Scale=0.9,\n    Extension = .ttf,\n    UprightFont=*-Regular,\n    BoldFont=*-Bold,\n    ItalicFont=*-Italic,\n    ]\nAnd then the command \\sffamily is the first line (below the YAML) in my Quarto document and states that I want to use the font I specified in the penguin-header.tex file.

The penguin-header.tex file defines a color for each penguin species—Chinstrap, Adelie, and Gentoo—that we can use to render different colors depending on which parameter value of species we select.\nBut how to connect the custom-defined color to our parameter so that the right one is used?\nIn an R code block, you can refer to your report parameters with params$species. If you want to reference these parameters in the Quarto text, enclose like so: `r params$species`. And what’s so neat about Quarto is that you can use this inline code as part of the LaTeX code. So the following command will set the text color to the custom color we defined based on the species determined via the parameter: \\color{`r params$species`}. If our parameter selects the Adelie species, then that piece of code will evaluate as \\color{Adelie} and our orange-y #FF6600 will be used. If you want to set the color back to black, use \\color{black}."

    "text": "Rendering parameterized reports\nThere are three ways to render this type of parameterized report using Quarto. In increasing order of complexity (and usefulness!):\nFirst. Manually change the parameter values in the header YAML of your .qmd file and hit Render in RStudio. This will create a PDF file in the same directory as your .qmd file with the same name as your .qmd file but with a .pdf extension. This is great for one-offs or for testing!\nSecond. If you prefer to work in the terminal, you can use the following command: quarto render penguins.qmd -P species:'Adelie' -P year:'2009'\nThird. For this palmerpenguins data, we have potentially nine separate PDF reports to create: three years for three species. That’s a little annoying to do via the first two methods, and you can imagine how really annoying it could get if you had even more parameter combinations. Thankfully, we can leverage the quarto::quarto_render() function in R to automatically create a report for each parameter combination we want and name that file in a way that we specify.\nrunpdfs &lt;- function(species, year) {\n  quarto::quarto_render(\n    \"penguins.qmd\",\n    output_format = \"pdf\",\n    execute_params = list(species = species, year = year),\n    output_file = glue::glue(\"{species} {year}.pdf\")\n  )\n}\n\npurrr::map2(unique(penguins$species), unique(penguins$year), \n            runpdfs)\nThe first chunk of code defines a new function called runpdfs that is based on the quarto::quarto_render() function. The two arguments to runpdfs are the two Quarto report parameters we have: species and year. Those arguments are used in the execute_params argument to specify the parameter values to Quarto and in the output_file argument to specify the name of the files.\nThe second chunk of code uses map2() from purrr to iteratively run that new function, runpdfs, for every unique combination of species and year from the penguins data set.\nThe code above will result in nine PDF files. The two available examples are Adelie 2009.pdf and Gentoo 2007.pdf."

To optimize the climate benefits of the program, we developed the Washington Climate Smart Estimator {WaCSE} using R and Shiny.\nIntegrating national climate models and datasets, this intuitive, regionally specific user interface allows farmers and policymakers to compare the climate benefits of different agricultural practices across Washington’s diverse counties and farm sizes. Users can explore GHG estimates in interactive tables and plots, download results in spreadsheets and figures, and generate PDF reports.

Here, we give short reproducible examples on how to download and visualize spatial data that can be useful in different settings. More extended examples and details about the capabilities of each of the packages can be seen at the packages’ websites and the rspatialdata website which provides a collection of tutorials on R packages to download and visualize spatial data using R."

Several R packages have been recently developed as clients for various databases that can be used for easy access to spatial data including administrative boundaries, climatic, and OpenStreetMap data. Here, we give short reproducible examples on how to download and visualize spatial data that can be useful in different settings. More extended examples and details about the capabilities of each of the packages can be seen at the packages’ websites and the rspatialdata website which provides a collection of tutorials on R packages to download and visualize spatial data using R."
